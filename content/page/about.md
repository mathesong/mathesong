My name is Granville Matheson and I'm a PhD student in neuroscience at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. 

My work is currently mostly focused on

* Pharmacokinetic modelling
* Statistical analysis
* Reproducible workflows
* Measurement error
* Image analysis


The purpose of this blog is to have a place to put fun little data-science side projects, tutorials, or really whatever ends up feeling interesting enough that I want to put it out into the world.  I'm a happy panda in R, and I love having an excuse to play with new packages, new visualisations, or exploring an interesting data set.

### My History

I'm a Scottish South African in Sweden.  I was born in South Africa to Scottish parents, and I'm currently living with my wife and daughter in Stockholm.  I started by studying chemistry with psychology as an extra subject because it seemed fun.  Psychology ended up being so interesting that I followed it and left chemistry behind.  Through psychology, I found brains so interesting that I gradually shifted over to neuroscience from psychology. And learning coding while doing neuroscience, I have found data science so much fun that I've been gradually shifting in that direction, which feels like a place I'd like to call my academic home.
